# Python_Sprint-
The aim of this program is to convert a given sequence of DNA into its protein equivalent.
In the creation of this program, I had to create 2 functions:
1) Translate function that when given a DNA sequence of arbitrary length, identifies and returns the amino acid sequence of the DNA using the amino acid SLC code.For example: DNA Input: ATTCTCATA  Output: ILI. 

2)Mutate function, This function reads in the contents of the text file named DNA.txt and identify the first occurrence of the lowercase letter 'a' in DNA.txt.
